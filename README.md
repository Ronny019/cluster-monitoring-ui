- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- Backend API running at `http://127.0.0.1:3333` (see API section below)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ronny019/cluster-monitoring-ui.git
cd cluster-monitoring-ui
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Running Tests

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for unit and integration tests.

### To run all tests:

```bash
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

## API Endpoints

The UI expects the following backend API endpoints to be available at `http://127.0.0.1:3333`:

- `GET /data/timeseries?cluster_id=...&type=...`  
  Fetches time series data for performance graphs (IOPS, Throughput).
- `GET /data/snapshot?cluster_id=...`  
  Fetches snapshot policy for a cluster.
- `PUT /data/snapshot`  
  Updates snapshot policy for a cluster.
